# MCPYE Documentation

## Installing the game

The game is currently not in a functional state, and cannot be played on any platform, but some of the program files will load in CLI (Command Line Interface, or text only) mode.

## Future instructions

**These instructions are only for when the game is functional.**

Installation is pretty simple.

### iPhoneOS

iPhoneOS support is coming soon. Despite the platform being incredibly old and obsolete, I still plan to support iPhoneOS 2 and 3 in the future.

### iOS

iOS support is coming soon. The supported versions of iOS will be iOS 4 and up.

### iPadOS

iPadOS support is coming soon. The supported versions of iPadOS will be iPadOS 13 and up.

### MacOS

Applies to Mac OS X 10.0 and above.

Make sure that Python is installed (version 3.6 or later) to do so, open your terminal and run the following command:

```
install python3
```

<!-- Next, go to the installer directory, located at /Installer/ and... !-->

No further instructions are currently available for MacOS

### Linux

#### Ubuntu

Applies to Ubunut 8.04 and up

Make sure that Python is installed (version 3.6 or later) to do so, open your terminal and run the following command:

```
sudo apt-install python3
```

Alternatively (but highly NOT recommended)

```
sudo snap install python3
```

<!-- Next, go to the installer directory, located at /Installer/ and... !-->

No further instructions are currently available for Ubuntu

#### Fedora

Applies to Fedora 18 and up

Make sure that Python is installed (version 3.6 or later) to do so, open your terminal and run the following command:

```
dnf install python3
```

Alternatively on Fedora 17 and below (and if DNF is not installed)

```
yum install python3
```

<!-- Next, go to the installer directory, located at /Installer/ and... !-->

No further instructions are currently available for Ubuntu

### Windows NT

#### Windows XP

Find and locate the MCPYE.EXE file and run it (make sure you get it from the correct source, and that you are using the Windows XP version)

64 bit versions of MCPYE are not available for Windows XP. Only 32 bit versions are available. Yes I know there is a 64 bit version of Windows XP, but I don't feel like supporting it yet.

Please note that since the installer is so small, it won't run. Currently, the installer only contains a message about the program not being functional yet.

For security reasons, you should NOT be using Windows XP outside of a virtual machine in the year 2021 or later. A virtual machine is your best friend in this case.

#### Windows Vista

Find and locate the MCPYE.EXE file and run it (make sure you get it from the correct source, and that you are using the Windows Vista version)

If you have the 64 bit version, but your Windows Vista virtual machine is 32 bit, it will not run. Make sure you are using the 64 bit version on 64 bit Windows.

Please note that since the installer is so small, it won't run. Currently, the installer only contains a message about the program not being functional yet.

For security reasons, you should NOT be using Windows Vista outside of a virtual machine in the year 2021 or later. A virtual machine is your best friend in this case.

#### Windows 7

Find and locate the MCPYE.EXE file and run it (make sure you get it from the correct source, and that you are using the Windows 7 version)

If you have the 64 bit version, but your Windows 7 virtual machine is 32 bit, it will not run. Make sure you are using the 64 bit version on 64 bit Windows.

Please note that since the installer is so small, it won't run. Currently, the installer only contains a message about the program not being functional yet.

For security reasons, you should NOT be using Windows 7 outside of a virtual machine in the year 2024 or later. A virtual machine is your best friend in this case.

#### Windows 8

Find and locate the MCPYE.EXE file and run it (make sure you get it from the correct source, and that you are using the Windows 8 version)

If you have the 64 bit version, but your Windows 8 virtual machine is 32 bit, it will not run. Make sure you are using the 64 bit version on 64 bit Windows.

No Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is available for MCPYE. The platform is too restrictive and time limited. I prefer to make software that can last forever.

Please note that since the installer is so small, it won't run. Currently, the installer only contains a message about the program not being functional yet.

For security reasons, you should NOT be using Windows 8 outside of a virtual machine in the year 2028 or later. A virtual machine is your best friend in this case.

##### Windows 8.1

See the above instructions, they are entirely the same.

#### Windows 10

Find and locate the MCPYE.EXE file and run it (make sure you get it from the correct source, and that you are using the Windows 10 version)

If you have the 64 bit version, but your Windows 10 virtual machine is 32 bit, it will not run. Make sure you are using the 64 bit version on 64 bit Windows.

No Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is available for MCPYE. The platform is too restrictive and time limited. I prefer to make software that can last forever.

Please note that since the installer is so small, it won't run. Currently, the installer only contains a message about the program not being functional yet.

For security reasons, you should NOT be using Windows 10 outside of a virtual machine in the year 2032 or later. I personally don't recommend using Windows 10 at all. A virtual machine is your best friend in this case.

#### Windows 11

MCPYE does not currently support Windows 11. Support may never be available. Please consider switching to Linux, BSD, or MacOS instead.

### Android

MCPYE for Android can be installed through F-Droid (at the moment, the package isn't available for F-Droid) I do not plan to post the software on the Google Play Store. If you see someone offering it, it is not legitimate, but feel free to try it out anyway, unless it costs money, then you are most likely being scammed. For now, if you can't get F-Droid, just install it from Google Play (price: $6.99 USD)

### Side note

I have been getting lots of issues being raised about the game not running. I have documented it very clearly that the game is not functional yet, but I don't feel I did a good enough job, so I made this documentation page today (2022, Monday, May 16th)
