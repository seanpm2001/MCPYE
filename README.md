Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Tetris128/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

## Pros of MC PYE

***

![Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg](/Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg)

[‚ñ™] it is written in Python, is open source, and follows a set of efficiency guidelines, so it is a lot lighter and a lot more efficient.

**Example:**

***

1. A Java Hello World program is normally between 5-10 lines while a Python Hello World program 1-2 lines

2. It is Open source

3. It is like Minecraft in terms of functionality but with every good mod installed and functional

<!-- 3. Not owned by Microsoft, this is either a pro or a con depending on how you look at it !-->

4. Thousands of features

5. Works online/offline

6. Game files are easy to modify and changable by all

7. Thousands of features

8. Has functionality for other sandbox games, such as Growtopia and Terraria

***

Now over 2000 blocks/mobs/items total

## More codenames

***

1. ‚Ä¢ Minecraft Python Edition

2. ‚Ä¢ Pycraft

3. ‚Ä¢ Minecraft 2

4. ‚Ä¢ Pymine

5. ‚Ä¢ Python Super Sandbox

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## Development progress

I decided to create a GitHub repository for this project on May 25th 2020, so that I could have help developing this project. I would have just uploaded the repository, but I needed to make some changes to the file structure. I also wanted to document it better.

As of 4:25 pm on May 26th 2020, I have added in all the files from my local repository, and I will begin working on changes soon

A snap is now under development - June 30th 2021
