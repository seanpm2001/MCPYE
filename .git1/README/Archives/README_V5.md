# Development progress

I decided to create a GitHub repository for this project on May 25th 2020, so that I could have help developing this project.
I would have just uploaded the repository, but I needed to make some changes to the file structure. I also wanted to document
it better.
As of 4:25 pm on May 26th 2020, I have added in all the files from my local repository, and I will begin working on changes soon

Do not modify version files.

Files ending with V and a number are separate archived versions of a program. They are complete, and should not be modified.
Always make sure to copy your changes to a new version file after you make each commit.

5. ¤ Source code must be documented
6. ¤ Python files must begin with #start of script and end with #end of script (this might get deprecated)
