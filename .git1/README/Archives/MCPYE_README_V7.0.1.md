Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Tetris128/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

## Pros of MC PYE

***

![Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg](/Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg)

[‚ñ™] it is written in Python, is open source, and follows a set of efficiency guidelines, so it is a lot lighter and a lot more efficient.

**Example:**

***

1. A Java Hello World program is normally between 5-10 lines while a Python Hello World program 1-2 lines

2. It is Open source

3. It is like Minecraft in terms of functionality but with every good mod installed and functional

<!-- 3. Not owned by Microsoft, this is either a pro or a con depending on how you look at it !-->

4. Thousands of features

5. Works online/offline

6. Game files are easy to modify and changable by all

7. Thousands of features

8. Has functionality for other sandbox games, such as Growtopia and Terraria

***

Now over 2000 blocks/mobs/items total

**More codenames**

***

1. ‚Ä¢ Minecraft Python Edition

2. ‚Ä¢ Pycraft

3. ‚Ä¢ Minecraft 2

4. ‚Ä¢ Pymine

5. ‚Ä¢ Python Super Sandbox

## Development progress

I decided to create a GitHub repository for this project on May 25th 2020, so that I could have help developing this project. I would have just uploaded the repository, but I needed to make some changes to the file structure. I also wanted to document it better.

As of 4:25 pm on May 26th 2020, I have added in all the files from my local repository, and I will begin working on changes soon

A snap is now under development - June 30th 2021
