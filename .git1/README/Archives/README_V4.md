# Development progress

I decided to create a GitHub repository for this project on May 25th 2020, so that I could have help developing this project.
I would have just uploaded the repository, but I needed to make some changes to the file structure. I also wanted to document
it better.
As of 4:25 pm on May 26th 2020, I have added in all the files from my local repository, and I will begin working on changes soon
